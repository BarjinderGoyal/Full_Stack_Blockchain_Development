Lexical Scope - Any inner function can have access to its outer scope variable
 
 Example- 

function outer(){
    var b=10;
    function inner(){
        console.log(b)
    }
}

In this example variable b is in lexical scope with respect to inner function.


Clouser- inner function combine with its lexical scope is closure.
