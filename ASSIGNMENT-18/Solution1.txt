Generator is a special kind of function which can return values multiple times every time we call it until yield statements finish.
Whenever we call the next function it runs the code starting from the previously executed statement until the next yield statement 
or until it reaches the end.

Regular Function - It does not have any yield statement and it only runs the entire code at once.
